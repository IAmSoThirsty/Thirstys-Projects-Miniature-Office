- Edit `run.py` and change `port=5000` to `port=8080`
- Then use `http://localhost:8080` instead

### "Can't connect from phone"
- Make sure phone and computer are on the **same WiFi**
- Check if firewall is blocking port 5000
- Try temporarily disabling firewall/VPN

### "Permission denied" on Mac/Linux
```bash
chmod +x install.sh start.sh
```

### Still having issues?
