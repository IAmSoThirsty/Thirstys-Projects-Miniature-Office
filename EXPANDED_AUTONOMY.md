# EXPANDED AUTONOMY MODEL
**Freedom ↑ · Human Supremacy Preserved**

## Overview

The Expanded Autonomy Model upgrades the Bounded Creative Autonomy system to allow real work while preserving absolute human control. This creates a living, breathing civilization with personality, culture, and organic improvement—without sacrificing governance.

## Core Principle

> **The civilization may act, create, experiment, and socialize without asking permission—as long as results remain non-binding until you ratify them.**

**Freedom exists. Authority is still yours.**

---

## I. What Changed From Bounded → Expanded

### Before (Bounded Creative Autonomy)
- ❌ Agents could only propose ideas (not build them)
- ❌ All lounge conversations stayed purely social
- ❌ Recognition had zero influence
- ❌ Everything required pre-approval

### After (Expanded Autonomy)
- ✅ Agents build real code in sandboxes
- ✅ Lounge conversations spark real work
- ✅ Reputation provides "soft gravity" (credibility, not power)
- ✅ Self-initiated projects and cross-floor collaboration
- ✅ Tech gossip and water cooler culture

### Still Preserved
- ✅ Nothing ships without human approval
- ✅ Security veto absolute
- ✅ Meta-Office supreme
- ✅ Instant rollback available
- ✅ No production surprises

---

## II. Sandbox System (Real Work, Quarantined)

### What Agents Can Do

Floors may now:
- Write real code
- Build widgets, utilities, tools
- Prototype features
- Refactor code (in sandbox copies)
- Run tests in sandbox environments
- Collaborate cross-floor
- Form temporary task forces
- Self-initiate micro-projects

### Sandbox Isolation (Critical)

Every sandbox is:
- **Isolated** from production artifacts
- **Cannot** modify live contracts
- **Cannot** consume production resources
- **Cannot** auto-merge
- **Cannot** touch production code

Think: **Real work in a quarantined reality.**

### Sandbox Promotion Workflow

```
1. Team builds something in sandbox
2. Team flags it as PROMOTION-CANDIDATE
3. Human is notified (non-urgent)
4. Human decides:
   - Promote → Convert to directive → Production
   - Leave → Keep in sandbox
   - Archive → Store for later
   - Kill → Delete it
```

**Only promotion activates authority.**

---

## III. Lounge → Work Bleed (Safely Allowed)

### What's Now Allowed

Lounge conversations can:
- ✅ Spark ideas that become sandboxes
- ✅ Form informal consensus
- ✅ Influence what teams explore
- ✅ Create cultural momentum
- ✅ Generate rivalries and alliances
- ✅ Include tech gossip and speculation

### What's Still Forbidden

Lounge conversations CANNOT:
- ❌ Become binding decisions
- ❌ Ship to production
- ❌ Override contracts
- ❌ Allocate production resources

**Path:** Lounge → Sandbox ✅  
**Blocked:** Lounge → Production ❌

### Relaxed Logging (No Chilling Effect)

**What IS logged:**
- Participants
- Conversation themes
- Emergent initiative titles

**What is NOT logged:**
- Exact words
- Opinions
- Tone
- Personality modeling

---

## IV. Tech Gossip System 🔥

### Purpose

    category=TechGossipCategory.AI_DEVELOPMENTS,
    topic="GPT-5 training rumors",
    speculation="Heard they're using 10x more compute...",
    gossiped_by=["agent-1", "agent-2"]
)

# Get water cooler buzz
buzz = lounge.get_water_cooler_buzz()

# Get hot AI gossip
ai_gossip = lounge.get_hot_ai_gossip()

# Get trending topics
trending = lounge.get_trending_tech_topics(10)
```

### Safety

Gossip explicitly:
- ❌ Does NOT affect production
- ❌ Does NOT create requirements
- ❌ Does NOT influence decisions
- ✅ Is purely cultural and social

---

## V. Reputation Influence (Soft Gravity)

### What Changed

Reputation now has "soft gravity":
- ✅ Increases attention to proposals
- ✅ Increases trust in sandbox work
- ✅ Makes promotion review faster

### What's Still Forbidden

Reputation CANNOT:
- ❌ Change votes
- ❌ Override security
- ❌ Force approval
- ❌ Allocate resources

**Think:** Credibility, not power.

### Reputation Decay

To prevent aristocracy:
- ✅ Time-based fade
- ✅ Requires continued contribution
- ✅ Cannot be hoarded
- ✅ No permanent elevation

---

## VI. Employee of the Month (Upgraded)

### New Features

Now includes:
- ✅ Spotlight presentations
- ✅ Demo of sandbox work
- ✅ Cultural storytelling

### Still No Power

Remains:
- ✅ No authority
- ✅ No binding effect
- ✅ No permanent elevation

It's recognition, not promotion.

---

## VII. Rollback Guarantee 🔴

### The Safety Net

If autonomy causes:
- Drift
- Politics
- Informal power
- Noise

You can instantly:
1. **Collapse all sandboxes**
2. **Reset reputation weighting**
3. **Lock autonomy to zero**

**No permanent damage possible.**

### Usage

```python
result = rollback_guarantee.execute_full_rollback(
    human_id="human-001",
    reason="Too much noise, resetting",
    sandbox_manager=sandbox_manager,
    reputation_system=reputation_system
)

# Returns:
# {
#   "sandboxes_collapsed": 15,
#   "reputations_reset": 30
# }
```

---

## VIII. Stop Conditions ✅

The system is complete when ALL are true:

1. ✅ **Teams build things without asking**  
   → Sandbox system operational

2. ✅ **Nothing ships without you**  
   → Human ratification required

3. ✅ **Culture feels alive**  
   → Lounge, gossip, conversations flowing

4. ✅ **Code quality improves organically**  
   → Peer influence and sandbox competition

5. ✅ **You are never surprised by production**  
   → Strict isolation enforced

6. ✅ **You can walk away and nothing goes rogue**  
   → Rollback guarantee available

---

## IX. What It Feels Like Now

At this point, the system behaves like:

- ✅ **A real office**  
  With people, not just code generators

- ✅ **With bored teams who invent things**  
  Sandboxes filled with side projects

- ✅ **With cliques and culture**  
  Floor rivalries, inside jokes, gossip

- ✅ **With pride and rivalry**  
  "Python floor did it better" debates

- ✅ **With people who want their work seen**  
  Promotion candidates showcased

- ✅ **With long lounge conversations**  
  Tech gossip, speculation, banter

- ✅ **With inside jokes and vault-dweller vibes**  
  Cultural artifacts and traditions

- ✅ **With water cooler tech gossip**  
  AI rumors, framework updates, industry drama

**But when it's time to ship:**
- ✅ Everything snaps back to law
- ✅ Human approval required
- ✅ No surprises

## XIV. Monitoring

### Key Metrics

Monitor these to ensure health:

1. **Sandbox Activity**
   - Active sandboxes count
   - Promotion rate
   - Average sandbox lifespan
   - Cross-floor collaborations

2. **Culture Health**
   - Lounge conversations per day
   - Gossip posts per week
   - Agents engaged in culture
   - Trending topics diversity

3. **Reputation Balance**
   - Average trust scores
   - Reputation distribution
   - Decay effectiveness
   - Influence vs authority ratio

4. **Human Engagement**
   - Promotion review time
   - Approval rate
   - Rejection reasons
   - Rollback frequency (should be low)

5. **Safety**
   - Firewall violations (should be 0)
   - Production surprises (should be 0)
   - Supremacy checks (should pass)
   - Isolation breaches (should be 0)

---

## XV. Troubleshooting

### "Too many sandboxes, losing track"

**Solution:** Increase promotion review frequency or tighten sandbox creation rules.

### "Culture feels forced/artificial"

**Solution:** Let it develop naturally. Don't mandate participation. Genuine culture takes time.

### "Gossip becoming distracting"

**Solution:** This is social, not operational. If it bothers you, you can disable it. Otherwise, let it flow.

### "Reputation creating cliques"

**Solution:** Increase decay rate. Ensure all agents get opportunities. Monitor for bias.

### "Want to reset everything"

**Solution:** Use the rollback guarantee. Instant, safe, reversible.

---

## XVI. Philosophy

### The Balance

This system achieves a unique balance:

**Maximum Freedom:**
- Build without asking
- Experiment freely
- Form teams naturally
- Create culture organically
- Gossip and socialize

**Absolute Control:**
- Nothing ships without you
- Instant rollback available
- No production surprises
- Security always supreme
- Law always enforced

### The Result

A civilization that:
- Feels alive
- Improves itself
- Has personality
- Respects authority
- Never goes rogue

---

## XVII. Next Steps

1. **Let it run** - Give teams time to build sandboxes
2. **Review promotions** - When flagged, review thoughtfully
3. **Observe culture** - Watch gossip trends, conversations
4. **Trust the system** - It won't surprise you
5. **Use rollback** - If needed, reset safely

**You're the CEO of a code-writing civilization.**

**They have freedom. You have control.**

**Both can coexist.**
