**A Civilization-Tier Cognitive IDE: Where Software Development Becomes Spatial Simulation**

It's a spatialized, agent-orchestrated development environment where code synthesis, review, and integration are modeled as a living organization inside a simulated world.

## Core Concept

**IDE × RTS × Organizational Simulation**

Less "write code" — More "run a software company in miniature"
