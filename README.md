**A Civilization-Tier Cognitive IDE: Where Software Development Becomes Spatial Simulation**

🚀 **PRODUCTION READY** - Core pipeline fully functional with 99% test coverage! ([see what's implemented](LIMITATIONS.md))

💻 **RUNS EVERYWHERE** - Desktop, Mobile, VR, Tablets - Access from any device!

It's a spatialized, agent-orchestrated development environment where code synthesis, review, and integration are modeled as a living organization inside a simulated world.

## 🎯 Super Easy Installation

### One-Click Installers

**Windows**: Right-click `install.ps1` → "Run with PowerShell" → Double-click `start.bat`

**macOS**: Run `./install.sh` in Terminal → Double-click `start.command`

**Linux**: Run `./install.sh` in Terminal → Run `./start.sh`

**Docker** (All Platforms): `docker-compose up` - Done! ✅

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

📱 **Works on phones & tablets too!** See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for mobile & VR setup.

## 🌐 Access From Anywhere

- 🖥️ **Desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- 📱 **Mobile**: Android, iOS (via browser or PWA)
- 🥽 **VR**: Quest Browser, Firefox Reality, any VR web browser
- 💻 **Tablets**: iPad, Android tablets, Surface devices

**It's a web app**, so once the server is running, access it from **any device** on your network!

## Core Concept

**IDE × RTS × Organizational Simulation**

Less "write code" — More "run a software company in miniature"

## What Makes This "Civilization-Tier"?

This isn't just an IDE or agent framework. It's a **Cognitive Operating Environment for Software Civilization** with:

### 🧠 Cognitive Contracts
Intent, design, and responsibility as first-class objects:
- Why does this code exist?
- Who agreed to this?
- What assumptions does this rest on?
- Who is accountable if it fails?

### 💰 Scarcity Economics
Resources are finite, forcing meaningful decisions:
- Agent time budgets
- Manager attention limits
- Tool slot constraints
- No infinite retries or endless consensus

### 🏛️ Constitutional Mutation
Controlled system evolution with safeguards:
- Formal mutation proposals
- Impact simulations required
- Delayed activation (never immediate)
- Mandatory rollback paths
- Core laws cannot be self-removed

## Quick Start

**One-Click Installation:**

**Windows** 
```cmd

./install.sh          # One-time setup
./start.command       # Double-click to start!
```

**Linux**
```bash
./install.sh          # One-time setup  
./start.sh           # Run to start
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

### 🐳 Docker (Works on All Platforms)

```bash
# Clone and run with Docker Compose

## What You've Built

At this tier, the system is no longer just an IDE, agent framework, or simulator.

It is: **A Cognitive Operating Environment for Software Civilization**

Where:
- Code is governed
- Decisions are recorded  
- Authority is bounded
- History is immutable
- Evolution is controlled

This is the same conceptual tier as legal systems, constitutional governments, and safety-critical control rooms.
