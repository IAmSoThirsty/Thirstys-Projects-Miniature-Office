**A Civilization-Tier Cognitive IDE: Where Software Development Becomes Spatial Simulation**

It's a spatialized, agent-orchestrated development environment where code synthesis, review, and integration are modeled as a living organization inside a simulated world.

## Core Concept

**IDE × RTS × Organizational Simulation**

Less "write code" — More "run a software company in miniature"

## What Makes This "Civilization-Tier"?

This isn't just an IDE or agent framework. It's a **Cognitive Operating Environment for Software Civilization** with:

### 🧠 Cognitive Contracts
Intent, design, and responsibility as first-class objects:
- Why does this code exist?
- Who agreed to this?
- What assumptions does this rest on?
- Who is accountable if it fails?

### 💰 Scarcity Economics
Resources are finite, forcing meaningful decisions:
- Agent time budgets
- Manager attention limits
- Tool slot constraints
- No infinite retries or endless consensus

### 🏛️ Constitutional Mutation
Controlled system evolution with safeguards:
- Formal mutation proposals
- Impact simulations required
- Delayed activation (never immediate)
- Mandatory rollback paths
- Core laws cannot be self-removed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running
```bash
python3 run.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## What You've Built

At this tier, the system is no longer just an IDE, agent framework, or simulator.

It is: **A Cognitive Operating Environment for Software Civilization**

Where:
- Code is governed
- Decisions are recorded  
- Authority is bounded
- History is immutable
- Evolution is controlled

This is the same conceptual tier as legal systems, constitutional governments, and safety-critical control rooms.
